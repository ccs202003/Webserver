# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- main

pool:

  displayName: cat /proc/cpuinfo; cat /proc/uptime; cat /proc/stat; bash run.sh
  strategy:
    runOnce:    #rolling, canary are the other strategies that are supported
